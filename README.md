Testing Galaxy for every one. My experience and suggestions

First at all I want to say that as a science fan and tech lover I consider Galaxy a incredible tool. Actually I saw all your tutorials and what Galaxy can do is really awesome.

I have been working training adults in different areas and lately in the use of internet tools to do virtual workshops in Latin America. So I consider myself kind of “good” at learning to use new platforms. Having said that I must admit that I couldn’t follow galaxy for everyone properly...

I didn't want the version in Spanish but it opened automatically and I couldn't change that (that happend in a Safary browser) so I changed to a Chrome browser and that problem didn't happen again (yey!). 

What is good:
- The instruccions are clear and the right order.
- They transmite optimism so is nice to read them.
- They show you what you could do and it give you an overview of the Galaxy's potential.

What could be better:
- I think would be interesting to have some notes over the imagens so the user can find where to click more easily. like this:

- I will include some short video tutorials because for some users that format could be more friendly.

- Provide links to the account login or register (register is not working properly in the instructions in Chrome browser but works well in Safary)

Any way I love the project and I will happily work to make it more accesible to different groups of people!
